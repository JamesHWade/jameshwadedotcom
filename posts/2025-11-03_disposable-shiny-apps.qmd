I build Shiny apps. A lot of them. I maintain a two-year-old app with a hundred-plus users. It has tests, CI/CD, and a backlog. I know the pain of longevity. But I also build apps for single meetings. They live for an hour and die gracefully.

This post is about the second kind.

## The moment everything stalls

You know the scene. You've crafted your narrative. You've polished the slides. You tell the story. And then a stakeholder asks:

> "That's interesting, but what if we looked at the data *this* way?"

Your answer: *"I'll have to get back to you on that."*

The conversation stops. You had their attention and you couldn't keep it, because a static slide deck can't bend to the question.

## Two traps

We don't build more apps because we fall into one of two traps.

**Trap 1: "Don't Build."** It's too much effort for just one meeting. The development hill looks too steep, so we default to slides.

**Trap 2: "Over-Build."** If I build it, it must be production-grade. We over-engineer a complex solution for a simple, one-off need.

The consequence of both traps is the same: death by PowerPoint.

## A third option

What if building an app for a single meeting was as easy as making a slide deck? That's the disposable app.

A disposable app:

- Gets its value from **immediate impact**, not longevity
- Is a **communication artifact**, not a production system
- Is designed to be **thrown away**

Think of it as a whiteboard sketch, not a monument. Valuable in the moment, erasable afterward.

## How to build one

The development hill isn't steep anymore. With AI-assisted coding, you can go from a question to a working Shiny app in about fifteen minutes.

### Step 1: Start with one question

A disposable app should do one thing well. Don't scope a dashboard — scope a question. For my talk, I used a question from my own house: twin toddlers in potty training, a four-year-old, four cats, and general chaos.

The question: **How can I track and optimize twin potty training success?**

The stakeholders (frazzled parents) needed real-time insights and encouragement.

### Step 2: Write a clear prompt

Describe what you want in plain English. Be specific about features and tools. Here's the actual prompt I used in Positron Assistant:

````markdown
@shiny your task is to build a fun and engaging shiny app all about potty training.

- The purpose of the app is to help my wife and me know what to do next
  when it comes to potty training _twins_ (yikes!).
- We are following _Oh Crap! Potty Training_ by Jamie Glowacki.

The app should consist of:
  - a page_sidebar where the left sidebar is a shinychat that we can use
    as our Jamie Glowacki stand-in in times of need. We should use
    `claude-sonnet-4` via ellmer as our guide.
  - a main page with trackers and graphs to track pees, poops, and
    parental sanity. Remember that it matters if we made it to the potty
    or if it was an accident.
  - For bonus points, you can include a prediction for the next "event".
  - You should give this a theme suitable for the task at hand.
    Use `_brand.yml` to help you out.

It is important to remember to treat the twins separately. This should
be easy, they are boy-girl twins named Henry and Penelope.
````

The key elements: a clear objective, specific features, UI preferences (`bslib`, sidebar layout), and enough context for the model to make reasonable choices.

### Step 3: Let AI generate the code

In minutes, the model creates a complete UI structure with `bslib` components, realistic data simulation, interactive visualizations, and `shinychat` integration. You need to watch it work. Not to micromanage, but to keep it on the rails.

### Step 4: Tweak and ship

Fix the inevitable broken pieces. Ask for minor layout adjustments. Swap in your actual data. The common time breakdown:

- Generation: 2–5 minutes
- Review: 2–5 minutes
- Tweaks: 5–10 minutes
- **Total: about 15 minutes**

Ship it and start getting feedback immediately.

## Overcoming the objections

### "Who will support it?"

Nobody. That's the point. You don't need a maintenance crew for a whiteboard drawing. You just erase it. This app took fifteen minutes to build. If we need it again, we'll build it again, probably better, because now we know more.

### "Won't this create app sprawl?"

Yes, potentially. (Frankly, I might be the wrong person to ask. I've been accused of being an app hoarder.) The key distinction: these are communication artifacts, not production systems. You must commit to throwing them away. If an app proves valuable enough to keep, that's a signal to build a real version with tests, CI/CD, and a maintenance plan. But most won't need that. Most were valuable for one meeting and one meeting only.

### "Isn't this more work than slides?"

Consider the actual time budget:

**A slide deck.** Initial creation: 3 hours. Tweaking chart alignment: 2 hours. Handling update requests: 2 hours. "Can you change the colors?": 1 hour. Total: 8 hours. Impact: low. Interactivity: zero.

**A disposable app.** Prompt and generation: 15 minutes. Integrating data: 30 minutes. Refine and test: 15 minutes. Total: 1 hour. Impact: high. Interactivity: infinite.

The ratio isn't close. And fun work goes by faster.

## The mindset shift

The tools are here. The only thing left is to change how we think.

| Old mindset | Disposable mindset |
|---|---|
| Perfection | Utility |
| Production-ready | Good enough is perfect |
| Full test coverage | Happy path only |
| Edge case handling | Fast to build |

This isn't about lowering standards. Production apps should be tested, maintained, and properly engineered. But not every app needs to be a production app. A napkin sketch isn't a failure of architecture. It's a different tool for a different job.

## The challenge

The next time you have a presentation, I challenge you:

**Open Positron before you open PowerPoint.**

Ask yourself whether your audience would rather look at your data or play with it. If the answer is play, build a disposable app. It'll take less time than you think, and the conversation it starts will be worth more than any slide deck.

And when the meeting's over, delete it.
