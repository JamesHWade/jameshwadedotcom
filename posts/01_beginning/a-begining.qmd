I have an idea for lowering the barrier to learn new R packages. I have built a few private packages, but nothing of mine fits the bill for what I want to try. There are uncountable resources for getting started with R, and I do not have much to add there. If you defied the odds and found this before you found [STAT 545](https://stat545.com/), I highly recommend that course. My idea is to integrate three fantastic tools for thought:

- Spaced repetition with [Orbit](https://withorbit.com/) created by [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)
- Building teaching curriculum for data science [with personas, concept maps, and thoughtful assessments](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/what-every-data-scientist-should-know-about-education/) as taught by Greg Wilson.
- Documentation following the [diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) popularized by [Daniele Procida](https://youtu.be/t4vKPhjcMZg)

I plan to start with [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and work my way up to [golem](https://golemverse.org/). Both packages have fantastic documentation already, and I will learn from and be inspired by that content as I go. I have maintained a minimal website for a few years, but Iâ€™ve never had something to show off there. I plan to create in the open so you can learn from my progress if not from the learning content I create.
