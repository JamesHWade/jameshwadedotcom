In chemistry and materials science research, data is messy, unstructured, and scattered. Solving this problem requires researchers to deeply embed within data generation and analysis workflows. We are on a multi-year journey to equip scientists and engineers with guidance and tools to extract insights from their data. I share our lessons from this journey learned through teaching, community building, and collaboration with a particular focus on the integration of language agnostic RStudio tools, products, and programs. I will especially be focusing on our experience with RStudio Academy.
