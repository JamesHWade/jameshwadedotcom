Hi 👋, I'm James Wade.

I'm a research scientist and analytical chemist at a large R&D organization. I still spend time in the lab, but I also build developer tools for researchers. Most of my work lives in the R and Python ecosystems. I build internal packages, ship Shiny apps to production, and maintain open source projects like [gptstudio](https://github.com/MichelNivard/gptstudio), [shinymcp](https://github.com/JamesHWade/shinymcp), and [deputy](https://github.com/JamesHWade/deputy).

Before all this, I was a bench chemist. I grew up in South Carolina and started my chemistry training at [Furman University](https://www.furman.edu/academics/chemistry/), a small liberal arts school in the upstate. That's where I found analytical chemistry—working on the abiotic origins of life, transition metal synthesis, and drug-DNA interactions for anticancer therapeutics.

I did my graduate work at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://chemistry.illinois.edu), in [Ryan Bailey's lab](https://www.baileylab.com), building silicon photonic biosensors and microfluidic tools for cancer diagnostics and precision medicine.

I live in mid-Michigan with my wife and son. My wife is a veterinarian who brings home too many furry friends—the current menagerie is two dogs and five cats.
